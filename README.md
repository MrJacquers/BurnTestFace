# BurnTestFace
Simple Garmin Watchface to check if your Amoled screen has any burn in.

Amoled looks great, but it suffers from burn in, which is actually pixels wearing out due to how these displays work. Garmin does a lot to minimize the effects, but the nature of these displays mean that eventually pixels will wear out and create the burn in / ghosting effect. This will be most visible in areas that are used the most and display static text. This watchface is meant as a diagnostic tool for you to check how worn out your screen is. Don't use it as a regular watchface ;)

Long press to cycle through the colors, or use the edit (pencil) icon when selecting the watchface on your watch to set the color.
